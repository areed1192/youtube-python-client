One of the ways I support the channel is by using Amazon Associates to earn fees on purchases you make. That means when you use the link above, it will track any purchases made from that link and give a small portion of it to the Sigma Coding. I love this approach because it allows you to do what you're already doing (shopping) but also helps support the channels you care about. Also, it makes it where I can invest that revenue to help improve and grow the channel.\n\nTags:\n--------------------------------------------------\n{}\n",
