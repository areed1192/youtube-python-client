                    "description": "A popular topic in the FinTech world is the development of Trading Robots, that can take trading strategies and execute them in an automate fashion with minimal or limited interaction. In this series, we kick off how to create a trading robot in python that will execute a simple strategy we define. In this particular video, we are going to take a look at the problem/solution before jumping into the code. I find this helps give us a framework to follow and keeps us focused when developing our program.\n\nVideo Resources:\n--------------------------------------------------\nhttps://github.com/areed1192/python-trading-robot\n\nResources:\n--------------------------------------------------\nFacebook Page: https://www.facebook.com/codingsigma\nFacebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/sigmacoding\nGitHub Sigma Coding: https://github.com/areed1192/sigma_coding_youtube\n\nSupport Sigma Coding:\n--------------------------------------------------\nPatreon: https://patreon.com/sigmacoding\nAmazon Associates: https://amzn.to/3bsTI5P **\n\nRelated Topics:\n--------------------------------------------------\nTitle: Building a Trading Robot in Python | Pt. 1\nLink: https://youtu.be/QAo0x9fE6ck\n\nTitle: Building a Trading Robot in Python | Pt. 2\nLink: https://youtu.be/c1See7jtRJ4\n\nTitle: Building a Trading Robot in Python | Pt. 3\nLink: https://youtu.be/z6ttrlG1maA\n\n**Amazon Associates Disclosure:\n--------------------------------------------------\nI am a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com.
